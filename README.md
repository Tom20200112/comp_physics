This repository is a collection of the lecture notes, programs and plots for the course Introduction to Computational Physics. The programs are mainly written in Python or Jupyter Notebook. 

This course is one of the fundamental courses designed for undergraduate physics majors. It teaches and covers numerical approximation, numerical algebra, numerical optimization, and stochastic simulation methods from a physics perspective. Through classroom teaching, practical exercises, homework assignments, and self-study, students will acquire basic computational physics skills, become familiar with general numerical methods for solving algebraic and differential equations, and gain an understanding of Monte Carlo simulation methods, density functional theory methods, molecular dynamics methods, and machine learning techniques. Additionally, the course offers optional content for students to self-study and expand their knowledge. The practical and basic computational physics knowledge provided by this course is intended for university students who plan to work in physics-related fields. Ultimately, the goal is for students to master, become familiar with, and gain an understanding of the relevant basic theories, techniques, and methods, and apply them to practical work.
